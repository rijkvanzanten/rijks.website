# Project 1: Learning to See

## Think Small

Volkswagen Group commissioned MMXVIII to create a campaign to promote the launch of their car into the US market.

The American market was used to big stylish vehicles which were everything the Volkswagen was not. In this campaign, we sought to accentuate the differences and emphasize the small size of the car in order to gain the attention of the viewer.

The typography is laid out in a “regular” three-column car adv. fashion so the viewer has a familiar point of reference. The unusual imagery combined with the large copy “Think small.” makes this piece a striking combination. The paragraph indents makes each point in the copy stand out and feel important.
