# Visual Culture Seminar

## Speakers

### Postlight

> Design with Courage

Those were the prime words that stuck to me after having visited Postlight, a design studio in Manhattan NYC. 

### Data Visualization for Social Good

_Aaron Hill — @aaronxhill — Parsons — The New School_

what is datavis: hard to define

"JS, interaction, numbers"
"view data in a new way in order to explore"
"translating computer data in a human readable format"
"infographic"
"how to make data available"
"document knowledge visually"
"explain data without words"
"analyzed data"
"a way of telling stories"
"making data easier to understand for people"

The moment you start working with data, you're designing

DV & CD is doing the same thing with a different form of information

> things like slideshows are dataviz, parsons course catalog is dataviz

> Data doesn't always fit into columns and rows

1850s london cholera outbreak map = dataviz

simple display of data can be extremely powerful

dataviz can be a way to convince people of certain data

process of understsanding the data that comes in is super important

the lost cat book map isn't useful initially. In order to make it useful:
1. Too much data / noise / invalid data
2. Dealing with outliers

**intend**: what do you want to do and why
acquire: get the data
parse: convert the data to a useful format
filter: get rid of outliers, aggregate dense data
mine: statistics / machine learinng to extract meaning
represent: represent the data visually
refine: refine the visual representation
interact: make it interactive
**publish**: make it available to the world

computers are dumb, human parsing is necessary in order to make sure that the dataset is actually useful.

context clues can only be seen and used by humans

**parse / filter is a lot of work**

represent: software doesn't matter, it's about ways to display the data:  
How should the data map to the visual representation?

Keep in mind that not every part of visual interface is in favor of transfering the data knowledge.

Jacques Bertin semiology of graphics:
* shape
* orientation
* color
* texture
* value
* size
* (placement)

basically any visualization can be reduced to points, lines, or areas.

Vox where we donate vs diseases that kill us chart is the worst chart ever made: 
* Circles aren't a good representation of data
* Data is not representable

Examples of good visualizations:
