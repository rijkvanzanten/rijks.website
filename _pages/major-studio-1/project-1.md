# Project 1

> Add a feature onto an app

I'm researching and designing a new integration between email clients and calendars. I'm trying to solve the problem of double bookings at certain time and dates.

## Design Brief

### Introduction

I think everyone has had an experience where they've set up a meeting or appointment with someone only to find out that they already had another thing planned at that exact same time.

It's especially bad when you only find out the day of the appointment itself.

In this project, I'll try to come up with an improved user experience which will alleviate the pain points of managing calendar appointments.

### Problem Definition

The flow of booking a meeting often happens in one of two ways:

1. The user doesn't check anything
1. The user goes back and forth between email & calendar client

I feel like we're all familiar with the problems that can arise when opting for the first way of booking meetings. This method is especially unsuitable for professional settings like setting up office or client meetings.

That doesn't mean that the second—I'd argue the most used way—of setting up meetings is perfect. The (context) switches between apps in the bottom half of the image above are especially troubling[^1]. Each time the user switch from application—eg from email to calendar—they need to re-adjust to the user interface which can cause confusion and frustration. Besides, I think most people might do another "pass" back-and-forth to double, and maybe even triple, check they got the dates, locations, and other information right.

### Design Challenge

How can a email application be extended in a way that allows the user to immediately check date and time availability in order to prevent double bookings from happening and in order to speed up and simplify the planning process?

#### Sub-questions

* Can this approach be used in other non-email contexts (f.e. WhatsApp or Telegram)?
* What are the differences in calendar usage between different user groups?
* What are the biggest competitors in this space?

### Stakeholders / Target audience

On the client side there is the original manufacturer of the email application that's being used. For this stakeholder, it's important that the solution coheres to the existing design language and system. It's also important that the solution provides the user with an improved experience which doesn't sit in the way when it's not used.

On the user side, it's quite hard to define a "calendar user" group. This group would contain basically all demographics. This group would become even broader if we rephrase it to "email users".

In order to have a specific sense of who to design this solution for, I'll be focusing on a group of which I think the calendar-email usage will be the biggest: Yuppies. Yuppies are self-absorbed young professionals, earning good pay, enjoying the cultural attractions of sophisticated urban life and thought, and generally out of touch with most challenges and concerns of less well-off people[^2].

### Trends & Threats

I think it's safe to say that as long as there are humans trying to connect with one another, there will be a need for a calendar in some fashion. The same can't be said for email however. The total volume of sent emails has dropped about 10 percent since 2010[^3].
